<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master's student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northwestern University supervised by [Prof. Igor Kadota](https://sites.northwestern.edu/kadota/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Beijing Jiaotong University supervised by [Prof. Jiayi Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiayizhang8650/). My current research interest is to develop theories and models that capture the fundamental limits and trade-offs of next-generation communication networks and multi-agent systems.
